Botforge lets you test your coding skills and your gaming skills at the same time.  You write a program to play one of the games supported by Botforge, and Botforge will play your program against other programs, as well as human users of the site.  Your program communicates with Botforge using a simple HTTP API.

Requirements:

* Ruby 2.2.0
* Bundler
* PostgreSQL

Once you've installed the bundle, you can run the server using <tt>rails s</tt>, and the tests using <tt>rake</tt>.
